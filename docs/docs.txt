# Builtin documentation file
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored
# Topics are separated by '\n\n-'
# New lines within topics are preserved, it is not width limited when printed

- Strict Mode
Strict mode ensures exact R5RS compliance.
Changes from R5RS when not in strict mode:
* The definition of whitespace allows all unicode whitespace, not just spaces
  and new lines.  (Note: particularly helpful on windows as this will allow
  carriage returns in source files).
* Unicode identifiers are allowed, source files are interpreted as being in
  utf-8 and identifiers are expanded from starting with [a-z] to starting with
  any alphabetic character.  Identifiers are changed from being allowed to
  contain [a-z0-9] and symbols after the first character to any alphanumeric
  unicode character and the same set of symbols.
