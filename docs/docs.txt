- Strict Mode
Strict mode ensures exact R5RS compliance, enabled by default.
Disabling strict mode (using '-s') enables all extensions listed below.
A single extension can be enabled using '-f <name>' or disabled using
'-f no-<name>' for more customisation.  The feature flags are applied after
the strict mode flag.
* extended-whitespace:
  The definition of whitespace allows all unicode whitespace, not just spaces
  and new lines.  (Note: particularly helpful on windows as this will allow
  carriage returns in source files).
* unicode-identifiers:
  Unicode identifiers are allowed, source files are interpreted as being in
  utf-8 and identifiers are expanded from starting with [a-z] to starting with
  any alphabetic character.  Identifiers are changed from being allowed to
  contain [a-z0-9] and symbols after the first character to any alphanumeric
  unicode character and the same set of symbols.
